# ðŸ“˜ Learning Java

Welcome to my **Java learning journey**! This repository will track my progress as I move from the very basics to advanced topics, including:

- âœ… Core Java fundamentals
- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts
- âœ… Collections and built-in Java libraries
- âœ… Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java
- âœ… Practice programs, exercises, and mini projects

Iâ€™ll be updating this repository regularly as I learn and improve.  
Feel free to explore and follow along!
